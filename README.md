- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I really learnt how to make use of grid more than the little that I knew about it. I'm always leaning towards using flexbox to solve my layouts however I found that grid was the best option for this design thanks to [SlayingTheDragon] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE&t=490s). His grid tutorial taught me so much in such a short space of time. It was a really fun challenge to build and I'm happy with the result, even so going a bit extra in making the design responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile. I think this has been my cleanest code I've ever written thus far although I'm sure I can still improve in many areas.

### Continued development

Keep learning more about grid and it's uses.
